Your task is to add a multi-language layer so that the user can switch between English, French, and Arabic.

Requirements

Global i18n architecture

Implement a clean internationalization (i18n) system for the whole app.

Do not hard-code any visible text in the UI anymore.

All labels, field placeholders, button texts, menu items, tooltips, and error/success messages must come from translation files or a translation dictionary.

Supported languages

Languages:

en = English (default)

fr = French

ar = Arabic

Create separate, well-structured translation files (or objects) for each language, with clear keys (for example: common.save, common.cancel, menu.inventory, form.productName, etc.).

Language switcher in the UI

Add a language selector (for example in the top bar / header).

The user must be able to choose between English, French, and Arabic.

When the user changes the language:

All visible text in the UI must instantly switch to the selected language.

Make sure this works across all pages/views of the app.

Persist user choice

Remember the selected language (for example using localStorage or equivalent) so that:

When the user refreshes the page, the app still uses their last chosen language.

If no language was chosen before, use English as the default.

Arabic specifics

For Arabic:

Use right-to-left (RTL) layout where needed (text alignment, direction).

Make sure the UI does not break when switching from LTR (English/French) to RTL (Arabic).

You can update the global dir attribute or apply a proper CSS/layout approach for RTL.

Coverage

Go through the existing UI and:

Move every visible text (buttons, labels, table headers, placeholders, messages, etc.) into the translation system.

Ensure there are no remaining hard-coded visible strings.

This includes:

Forms and dialogs

Menus and navigation

Tables and lists

Validation messages and error/success notifications

Code quality

Keep the implementation clean and easy to extend if we add more languages later.

Add comments where needed to explain how to:

Add a new language

Add a new translation key

Please:

Implement all necessary code changes.

Show me where the translation files are located.

Show me where the language selector is implemented and how the language is stored and loaded.
